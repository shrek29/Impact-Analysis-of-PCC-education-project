# Impact-Analysis-of-PCC-education-project
Impact assessment of the ‘Sikshak Sahayogi Dal’ project undertaken by Pune City Connect(PCC), an organization which is an amalgam of government and corporate entities working collectively to bring educational equity in the city of Pune, Maharashtra, India.

This report was the outcome of my research study about the project during my summer intership at Teach for India.

As part of its objective to provide quality education, PCC decided to build a sustainable and collaborative government education system that is deeply committed to improve the quality of student learning in Pune Municipal Schools by creating a cadre of Teacher Development Officers (Shikshak Sahyogi Dal) who will be committed to improve the instructional skills and to develop the right mind-sets of the teachers to improve teaching learning process in Pune Municipal Schools.

This report highlights the impact the Sikshak Sahyogi Dal has created in its first year i.e. the academic year of 2015-2016. Time given to this assessment study was limited to one month(May 2016). The study tried to capture the essence of the project within the given period. This report is the outcome of the study. The objective of this exercise was to draw lessons from the project to enable both PCC and the
PMC to analyze the impact of the Shikshak Sahyogi Dal in the classrooms of Pune which would further enable the planning and development of the project in its second year and to identify areas in which improvements would be necessary to enhance its impact.
