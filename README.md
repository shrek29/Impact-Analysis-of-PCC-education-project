# Impact-Analysis-of-PCC-education-project
As part of my two year fellowship with Teach for India, i interned at Pune City Connect(PCC) an organization which is an amalgam of government and corporate entities working collectively to bring educational equity in the city of Pune, Maharashtra, India. I was primarily responsible to create an Impact assesment of one of their education projects ‘Sikshak Sahayogi Dal’ which was launched to improve the performance of teachers in vernacular medium schools in the city of Pune. The report is an outcome of my research.

Below is a brief description of fhe organization and the program:

As part of its objective to provide quality education, PCC decided to build a sustainable and collaborative government education system that is deeply committed to improve the quality of student learning in Pune Municipal Schools by creating a cadre of Teacher Development Officers (Shikshak Sahyogi Dal) who will be committed to improve the instructional skills and to develop the right mind-sets of the teachers to improve teaching learning process in Pune Municipal Schools.

This report highlights the impact the Sikshak Sahyogi Dal has created in its first year i.e. the academic year of 2015-2016. Time given to this assessment study was limited to one month(May 2016). The study tried to capture the essence of the project within the given period. This report is the outcome of the study. The objective of this exercise was to draw lessons from the project to enable both PCC and the
PMC to analyze the impact of the Shikshak Sahyogi Dal in the classrooms of Pune which would further enable the planning and development of the project in its second year and to identify areas in which improvements would be necessary to enhance its impact.
